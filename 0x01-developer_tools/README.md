## How to use the elements tab to edit HTML and CSS

To the right of the HTML view in the “Elements” tab, there is a view showing a breakdown of what CSS rules apply to the selected element. This view can be extremely helpful for debugging a plethora of CSS bugs. For example, because you can see what rules apply to the current element, you can identify if an element is getting CSS rules that you didn’t expect or is missing CSS rules you thought applied to it. The CSS view also shows when a style applied by a matching rule is being overridden by a more specific rule.
